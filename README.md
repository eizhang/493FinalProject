Our main project sectio is shown in index.html. Currently we are working on adding more levels and refining the functionality that weaves the sections together. The first four levels contain the animation that will pop up when you loose a level while the other 5 levels do not, the game over screen has still not been created, so currrently you can play the game even when you do no have a life left to play. The maze graphic is also up but the actual maze does not yet work. 

This game is meant to have nonsensical answers, thus we have provided the correct answer to each level such that the instructors can play the whole game with minor frustration:


Question 1: H
Question 2: Berry->Apple->Nectarine->Apple->Nectarine->Apple
Question 3: Click on Kuzco (the llama)
Question 4: left most button (after the flash)
Question 5: Behind you
Question 6: Can you not
Question 7: Move your mouse around the page to an image that says "click me" in cursive
Question 8: blue->orange->green->green->yellow
Question 9: click "click!" -> click "click me now!"

Game over!!
