Our main project section is shown in index.html. For the final version of our web-based application, our team designed 16 levels, each with a unique answer continuing the theme of unorthodox answers. All interactions are point-and-click based for a simple UX, allowing the user to focus the actual state of the system versus how to best interact with the system. Levels consist of standard one-question-one-answer questions, spelling challenges, a maze, a rapid-click challenge, a pop-culture reference, and timed challenges. All artwork, minus the Disney characters, were custom-made by the team. 

This game is meant to have nonsensical answers, thus we have provided the correct answer to each level such that the instructors can play the whole game with minor frustration:

Question 1: the Blue
Question 2: Click the question mark "?" in the question
Question 3: Michigan (obviously)
Question 4: Spam the "study" button until bar fills
Question 5: H
Question 6: Berry->Apple->Nectarine->Apple->Nectarine->Apple
Question 7: Click on Kuzco (the llama)
Question 8: top left most button (after the flash)
Question 9: Behind you
Question 10: Can you not
Question 11: Click the squirrel
Question 12: red-orange-white-purple-orange-red-teal
Question 13: click on baby corgi, follow path with mouse cursor, click momma corgi
Question 14: Window
Question 15: Pause and don't click anything for 7 seconds 
Question 16: LEGEND

Game over!!
